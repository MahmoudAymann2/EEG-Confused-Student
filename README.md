#Overview

This project involves an in-depth analysis of an EEG dataset collected from students during various tasks. The goal is to understand the patterns and trends in the EEG data, particularly in relation to student confusion and engagement levels.

#Dataset

The dataset used in this analysis is contained in the EEG Confused Student.ipynb notebook. The dataset includes various features related to EEG signals, such as:

Participant ID

Task type

EEG signal data (e.g., various frequency bands)

Annotations of confusion levels

Time stamps


#Libraries and Tools Used

The analysis was conducted using the following libraries and tools:

Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.

NumPy: For numerical computations.

Matplotlib: For data visualization.

Seaborn: For statistical data visualization.

Scikit-learn: For machine learning algorithms and analysis.

MNE: For EEG data processing and visualization.

Jupyter Notebook: For interactive data analysis and visualization.

#Key Analysis and Visualizations

The project includes various analyses and visualizations, such as:

Descriptive Statistics: Summarizing the main characteristics of the dataset.

Signal Processing: Cleaning and processing EEG signals.

Feature Extraction: Extracting relevant features from the EEG data.

Correlation Analysis: Investigating relationships between EEG features and confusion levels.

Classification Models: Building machine learning models to classify confusion levels.

Visualization: Plotting EEG signals and confusion levels to identify patterns
